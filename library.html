      <p>
        In the heart of an ancient city lies a library untouched by time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its shelves are filled with books no one dares to open, for within them lie truths too powerful for the unprepared.

      <blockquote>
        "Knowledge hides not in sight, but in places the eye forgets to see."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        There’s a fragment of wisdom locked away here.  
        It won’t be on the shelves or in the open halls.  
        You must read between the lines — search where ordinary readers never look. 📖
